A series of Notebooks on the fundemental techniques used in Computer Vision for quick access. Based on the book `Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision`.

All the contents are for educational purposes only. Information may be not accurate or not complete. Check the topic, get the general understanding and learn more about them on your own!

Refer the Original Repo for Complete implementations of code segments. I only included the once which I think important to me for quick references. [Original Repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/practical-ml-vision-book)
